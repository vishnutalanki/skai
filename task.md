### Task Overview

You will outline the steps and considerations involved in designing an AI co-design agent that assists curriculum designers in creating and refining middle school instructional materials. Your solution should demonstrate how AI can augment (not replace) the curriculum design process. Using the provided materials related to Grade 6, Unit 2a, you will detail how it would assist a curriculum designer in developing Unit 2b.


### Task Components

Analysis and Planning:

Describe how you would analyze the provided materials to understand the existing curriculum's structure, standards alignment, and pedagogical approach.
Outline the key features and functionalities you would incorporate into your co-design agent to support the development of Unit 2b.
Explain how you would ensure the agent's recommendations align with the ELA standards and promote student engagement.

Feature Design:
Detail how the agent would suggest modifications to improve student engagement with poetry and identity themes.
Describe how the agent would generate supplementary materials that support diverse expressions of identity.
Explain how the agent would provide data-informed recommendations for scaffolding poetry analysis skills.

Technical and Ethical Considerations:
Describe the key architectural decisions you would make in designing the agent.
Outline the steps you would take to address data privacy considerations specific to K-12 education.
Explain how you would implement appropriate guardrails for AI-generated content, especially for identity-related topics.

Optional Prototype (If Time Allows):
If you have time, you are welcome to create a simplified prototype or a visual representation of a key feature of your co-design agent. This prototype does not need to be fully functional but should demonstrate your understanding of the task requirements.
